# AIP490 - Virtual Shirt Fitting Model Based on Deep Learning and Computer Vision

## Dataset
We train and evaluate our model using the dataset from [HR-VITON â€” Official PyTorch Implementation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11d1IKZ-jsK9mx0BSQmxrEqLxAA00C3IO/view?usp=drive_link).

To download the datasets, please check the following links:
- Our preprocessed dataset: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iHoiyTnRF2lMFN95f37s8-4G2-Plp5Zb/view?usp=sharing)
- Authors' preprocessed dataset: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/190xa7nb92KNWc4EF9pxP0YJ8pWu1NkU8/view?usp=sharing)

We assume that you have downloaded it into `./data`.

If you want to know more about how we preprocess the data, please check the [Preprocessing.md](https://github.com/ntad27/AIP490/blob/main/Preprocessing.md)

## Inference
Here is the [link](https://virtual-shirt-fitting.anvil.app/) for the web app demo.

We used [Anvil](https://anvil.works/) to build our web demo so you need to run the following notebook so that the web can work smoothly
