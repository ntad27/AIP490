# Data preprocessing

According to the explanation from the authors in [Preprocessing.md](https://github.com/sangyun884/HR-VITON/blob/main/Preprocessing.md). At least 6 steps are needed for getting all the required inputs of the model. Thanks to this [detailed instructions](https://github.com/sangyun884/HR-VITON/issues/45), we have reproduced all of the required preprocessing steps.

We've added one more preprocessing step and modified other steps in order to get better try-on results.

Please check the following notebook if you want to try on your own data
