# Data preprocessing

According to the explanation from the authors in [Preprocessing.md](https://github.com/sangyun884/HR-VITON/blob/main/Preprocessing.md). At least 6 steps are needed for getting all the required inputs of the model. Thanks to this [detailed instructions](https://github.com/sangyun884/HR-VITON/issues/45), we have reproduced all of the required preprocessing steps. 

## 1. Remove background
## 2. OpenPose
## 3. DensePose
## 4. Cloth Mask
## 5. Human Parse
## 6. Parse Agnostic
## 7. Human Agnostic
